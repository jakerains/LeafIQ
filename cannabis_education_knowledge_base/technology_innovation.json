      "response": "Technology is revolutionizing how people interact with cannabis! Dosing apps help track your consumption, effects, and optimal timing â€“ apps like Releaf, Strainprint, and CannaPass let you log different products and monitor how they affect you. Vaporizer technology has advanced significantly with precise temperature controls, smartphone connectivity, and dosing features. Some devices like the Volcano or Pax connect to apps for customized sessions. Delivery platforms make cannabis more accessible where legal, with services like Eaze and Dutchie offering online ordering and delivery tracking. Lab testing technology ensures product safety and potency, with QR codes on packaging often linking to detailed test results. Some dispensaries use AI-powered recommendation systems to suggest products based on your preferences and past purchases. Emerging technology includes nanotechnology for faster-acting edibles, precision dosing devices, and even VR experiences for cannabis education.",
