# Staff Chatbot Fixes - Conversational & Educational 

## Problem Identified
The staff chatbot was too rigid and categorical, jumping to product recommendations instead of having natural conversations. Users wanted to be able to ask follow-up questions and have flowing discussions like talking to a real budtender.

## Root Cause
The chatbot was categorizing queries too strictly instead of maintaining conversation context and flowing naturally between education, recommendations, and follow-up questions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Conversational System Prompt** 
Completely rewrote the AI's personality to be conversational rather than categorical:

```typescript
// NEW: Natural conversation approach
Your personality traits:
- Conversational and friendly, like talking to a knowledgeable colleague
- Educational but not preachy - you love sharing knowledge naturally
- Encouraging of questions and follow-ups
- You use natural conversational phrases and adapt to the flow of discussion

CONVERSATIONAL APPROACH:
**Natural Flow**: Respond conversationally to whatever the person asks. 
Don't categorize their questions - just have a natural discussion.

**Follow-up Friendly**: Always encourage questions. End responses with:
- "What else would you like to know about that?"
- "Any other questions about this?"
- "Curious about anything else?"

**Conversation Memory**: Reference what you've discussed earlier when relevant.
```

### 2. **Conversation Context Support**
Added conversation history to maintain context across messages:

```typescript
// Pass last 6 messages as context to the AI
const conversationContext = chatHistory.slice(-6).map(msg => ({
  role: msg.type === 'user' ? 'user' : 'assistant',
  content: msg.text
}));

// Edge function now uses conversation context in AI messages
const messages = [
  { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
  ...conversationContext.slice(-4), // Last 4 messages for context
  { role: 'user', content: userPrompt },
];
```

### 3. **Smarter Product Logic**
Updated when to show products to support natural conversation flow:

```typescript
// More conversational approach - show products when it makes sense
function shouldUseInventoryRAG(query: string): boolean {
  // Direct requests: "What gummies do you have?"
  // Recommendations: "What's good for sleep?"
  // Effects mentioned: "I need help with anxiety"
  // Default to showing products for conversational flow
  return true; // (with specific educational exceptions)
}
```

### 3. **Knowledge Source Indicators Still Work**
The KB badges are fully functional:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green "KB" badge** = Response from Pinecone vector store
- ðŸŸ  **Orange "Local" badge** = Fallback response  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Context badge** = Products based on conversation history

## Expected Behavior Now

### **Conversational Flow Examples**

**Scenario 1: Educational Question with Follow-up**
```
User: "What are terpenes?"
Bud: [Educational explanation] "What else would you like to know about that?"
User: "Which terpenes help with sleep?"  
Bud: [Explains sleep terpenes + shows relevant products]
```

**Scenario 2: Recommendation Request**
```
User: "What's good for sleep?"
Bud: [Educational context about sleep + cannabis + shows sleep products]
User: "What about for beginners?"
Bud: [References previous sleep discussion + shows beginner-friendly options]
```

**Scenario 3: Direct Product Request**
```
User: "What edibles do you have?"
Bud: [Brief info about edibles + shows product grid]
User: "Which ones are strongest?"
Bud: [References previous edibles + shows high-potency options]
```

### **Knowledge Source Indicators**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green "KB" badge** = Response from Pinecone vector store 
- ðŸŸ  **Orange "Local" badge** = Fallback response
- ðŸŽ¯ **Context badge** = Products based on conversation history

## How to Test Conversational Flow

1. **Navigate to Employee Kiosk â†’ Bud AI Budtender**

2. **Start an Educational Conversation:**
   - Ask: "What are terpenes?"
   - Look for: Educational response + follow-up invitation
   - Follow up: "Which ones help with sleep?"
   - Look for: References previous topic + sleep-specific info + products

3. **Test Product Conversation:**
   - Ask: "What's good for sleep?"
   - Look for: Educational context + sleep products
   - Follow up: "What about dosing?"
   - Look for: Dosing advice that references sleep context

4. **Check Knowledge Badges:**
   - Look for green "KB" badges under Bud's avatar
   - Try questions when offline to see orange "Local" badges

## Key Success Indicators

âœ… **Natural conversation flow** - not rigid categories  
âœ… **Follow-up questions work** - maintains context  
âœ… **Educational content weaves naturally** with recommendations  
âœ… **KB badges appear** for vector store responses  
âœ… **Conversation memory** - references previous topics  

The chatbot is now a **conversational cannabis expert** that adapts to natural discussion flow, maintains context, and provides both education and recommendations as the conversation unfolds.
